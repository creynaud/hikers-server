Hikers Log server API
=====================

This APIÂ is inspired by the couchdb document API: http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Document_API

Getting a document
------------------
To retrieve a document, simply perform a GET operation at the document's URL::

    GET /api/document/some_doc_uuid HTTP/1.0
    Accept: application/json

Here is the server's response::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
        "uuid":"some_doc_uuid",
        "rev":"1-946B7D1C",
        "type":"hike",
        "name":"Grande Casse",
        "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
        "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
    }

Creating a document
-------------------
The POST or PUT operations can be used to create a new document::

    POST /api/document/ HTTP/1.0
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    {
        "uuid":"some_doc_uuid",
        "type":"hike",
        "name":"Grande Casse",
        "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
        "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
    }

Note that the uuid is not mandatory in the case of a creation. If the uuid is not specified, the server will generate one.

Here is the server's response::

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"ok":true, "uuid":"some_doc_uuid", "rev":"1-946B7D1C"}

Updating a document
-------------------
The POST or PUT operations can be used to update a document::

    PUT /api/document/ HTTP/1.0
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    {
        "uuid":"some_doc_id",
        "rev":"1-9242ABCD",
        "type":"hike",
        "name":"Grande Casse",
        "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
        "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
    }

Here is the server's response::

    HTTP/1.1 200 Updated
    Content-Type: application/json
    {"ok":true, "uuid":"some_doc_uuid", "rev":"2-946B7D1C"}

Note that if you don't specify the "rev" in the request json body or
specify a "rev" that is not the current object revision, then the a conflict
will occur::

    HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "error":"conflict",
        // In case of a conflict, the latest version available on the server is returned
        "doc": {
            "uuid":"some_doc_id",
            "rev":"2-8812BBCD",
            "type":"hike",
            "name":"Grande Casse, Vanoise",
            "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
            "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
        }
    }

Deleting a document
-------------------
To delete a document, perform a DELETE operation at the document's location, passing the rev parameter with the document's current revision::

    DELETE /api/document/some_doc_uuid?rev=2-1582603387 HTTP/1.0

And the response::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Deleting a document without specifying the revision will result in a conflict response::

    HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "error":"conflict",
        // In case of a conflict, the latest version available on the server is returned
        "doc": {
            "uuid":"some_doc_id",
            "rev":"3-8812BBCD",
            "type":"hike",
            "name":"Grande Casse, Vanoise",
            "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
            "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
        }
    }

Getting changes on documents
----------------------------
To get the changes on a specific list of documents, perform a POST or a PUT to the changes URL::

    POST /api/changes/ HTTP/1.0
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    {
        "changes_requested":
        [
            {"uuid":"uuid1", "rev":"1-967a00df"},
            {"uuid":"uuid2", "rev":"2-7051cbe5"},
            {"uuid":"uuid3", "rev":"2-eec205a9"}
        ]
    }

The response will contain the documents status ("updated", "did_not_change" or
"does_not_exist"). In case of an update, the new document will be available in
the response::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "results":
        [
            {"uuid":"uuid1", "status": "updated", "doc":
                {
                    "uuid":"uuid1",
                    "rev":"2-9242ABCD",
                    "type":"hike",
                    "name":"Grande Casse",
                    "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
                    "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
                },
            }
            {"uuid":"uuid1", "status": "did_not_change"},
            {"uuid":"uuid3", "status": "does_not_exist"},
        ]
    }

Note that the "does_not_exist" status does not mean that the document never
existed. It could have been deleted.

Bulk creations, updates and deletions
-------------------------------------
To perform documents creations, updates and deletions in one request, one can use the following bulk operation via POST or PUT::

    POST /api/bulk/ HTTP/1.0
    Content-Type: application/json
    Accept: application/json
    {
        "operations":
        [
            {"uuid":"uuid1", "operation": "create", "doc":
                {
                    "uuid":"uuid1",
                    "type":"hike",
                    "name":"Grande Casse",
                    "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
                    "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
                }
            },
            {"uuid":"uuid2", "operation": "update", "doc":
                {
                    "uuid":"uuid2",
                    "rev":"2-7051cbe5",
                    "type":"hike",
                    "name":"Pointe des Cerce",
                    "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
                    "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
                }
            },
            {"uuid":"uuid3", "operation": "delete", rev":"2-eec205a9"},
            {"uuid":"uuid4", "operation": "update", "doc":
                {
                    "uuid":"uuid4",
                    "rev":"4-1111aae5",
                    "type":"hike",
                    "name":"Aiguille Noire",
                    "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
                    "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
                }
            }
        ]
    }

The response will contain the results of the operation::

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    {
        "results":
        [
            {"uuid":"uuid1", "status": "created", "rev": "1-9242ABCD"},
            // In case of a conflict, the latest version available on the server is returned
            {"uuid":"uuid2", "status": "conflict", "doc":
                {
                    "uuid":"uuid2",
                    "rev":"3-4462aae5",
                    "type":"hike",
                    "name":"Pointe des Cerces",
                    "owner":"thebrain@acme.com",
                    "date": "2013-08-29T14:30:55Z"
                }
            },
            {"uuid":"uuid3", "status": "deleted"},
            {"uuid":"uuid4", "status": "updated", "rev": "5-3312CCCD"},
        ]
    }

By default, the bulk call tries to perform as much operations as possible, and just returns failure or conflict for the operations
which cannot be completed.

Maybe we can add a transactional option later, i.e all operations are performed or none are performed.
